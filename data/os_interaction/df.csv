In this scenario, you have a log file named ""system_logs.log"" which records specific activities on your Linux (Ubuntu) operating system. The log file contains multiple lines of data with a timestamp, event type (error or_success), user ID, and action message.

Here's an example of a log entry: 
`2022-11-15 18:03:23 error 28 Directory_not_found`

The user ID is an integer (between 1 and 50), and the number of error events varies.

Your task is to create a script that counts the total number of error events in the log file for a specific user ID, provided as an input argument.

The output should be a single integer representing the total number of error events.",,,,,,,python,check/integer-match.py,,,,,,,,"To solve this problem, you can use a combination of Linux commands, including `grep`, `awk`, and `wc`. First, filter the log file for lines containing the ""error"" event type. Next, further filter the result to match the user ID provided as an argument. Finally, count the number of lines to determine the total number of error events for the specific user ID.",,,
"As a Linux user, you are required to find the total number of unique characters in a given log file. The file does not have any newline characters. The purpose of this problem is to identify your understanding of file management and text processing using command line.

**Instructions:**

1. In your Linux (Ubuntu) operating system initialize a file called `logfile.txt`.

2. Count and print the number of unique characters in the `logfile.txt` file. The result must be an integer.",,,,,,,python,check/integer-match.py,,,,,,,,"To solve this problem, you will need to use several Linux command line utilities to manipulate the text in the `logfile.txt` file. Here are some hints to help you:

1. Use `fold` command to remove newline characters (if any) in the file
2. Use `grep`, `tr` or `sed` command to eliminate duplicates
3. Use `wc` command to count characters",,,
"As a student, your task is to determine how many lines of code (LOC) are written in the C programming language within a given directory structure. This directory structure contains multiple subdirectories and files with different programming languages.

You need to count the number of lines in all .c files present in the given directory and its subdirectories; your answer must be an integer.

Note: You are only allowed to use the Linux command line and its utilities; you cannot use any other scripts or software to perform this task.",,,,,,,python,check/integer-match.py,,,,,,,,"To solve this problem, the student can use a combination of basic command-line utilities like `find`, `grep`, `wc`, and pipes.

1. Utilize the `find` command to list all .c files in the given directories and subdirectories.
2. Use `grep` with the '-c' option to count the number of lines of code (LOC) in each .c file.
3. Then, use pipes to combine these output results and sum them up with a small AWK script.
4. Finally, the output will show the total number of LOC in the .c files in the given directory, including subdirectories.",,,
"In this problem, you need to analyze the file system usage (in kilobytes) in a Linux operating system. You will be given a directory in the initialization phase. You need to find out the total number of kilobytes used by all files within that directory (including subdirectories).

Your task is to calculate the total file size in kilobytes within the provided directory, ignoring the sizes of any folders. The answer should be an integer value.",,,,,,,python,check/integer-match.py,,,,,,,,"To solve this problem, you can use the `du` command to estimate file space usage. You can also use the `-s`, `-b`, and `--apparent-size` flags to display only the total size of the given directory and obtain sizes in bytes. You may calculate the file sizes in kilobytes by dividing the total bytes by 1024, rounding up to the nearest integer.",,,
